The web appâ€™s functionality is simple and minimal. It uses the concepts of Deep Learning to predict the Traffic signs and notify the same to the user by sending them a caution message.

### CONCEPTS USED TO BUILD THE PROJECT

- Machine Learning Data Preprocessing
- Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) : Model Building and Training
- SMS Service APIs

### FEATURES OF THE PROJECT
- Users can Signup for registration.
- Registered Users get a SMS notification when the traffic signs are detected.
- The model is capable of detecting over 40 classes of Traffic signs.

### APPLICATION OF THE PROJECT
This technology could be applied in self-driving and automated cars, where the captured images are detected and the car could take the respective actions.
